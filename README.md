Research into mobile phone contact tracing as part of a strategy to control COVID-19 after an initial outbreak

The code here is a contact tracing model based on the model described in Hellewell et.al., 2020. [Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts.](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30074-7) The Lancet Global Health. 8: e488â€“96

Please see [this whitepaper](/doc/ContactTracingPolicy.pdf) for some model results.

Also, see [this whitepaper](/doc/DecentralisedInference.pdf) for details of a privacy-preserving way of doing Bayesian inference to identify people at-risk of infection given when using mobile-phone contact tracing.
