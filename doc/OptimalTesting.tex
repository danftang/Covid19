\begin{abstract}
With the recent announcement\cite{applegoogle} that Apple and Google will introduce a contact-tracing API to iOS and Android, and later add contact tracing functionality directly to their OS's, it seems increasingly likely that contact tracing via a smart phone will form an important part of the effort to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent resurgences of the disease after an initial outbreak.

In this paper we develop an optimal testing schedule

Suppose we have a number of tests $1...n$ that give us information about whether a person is infected with a disease. The characteristics of the $n^{th}$ test are defined by it's specificity, $P_n(-|\bar{i})$, which gives the probability that a non-infected person will test negative if tested with test $n$ , and it's sensitivity $P_n(+|i,\Delta t)$ which gives the probability that a person infected due to an exposure at a time $\Delta t$ before the test will test positive if tested with test $n$.

Suppose the tests are used in the context of contact tracing and we assess the probability that person A is infected as $P_A(i)$. Suppose person B has been identified as having had a close contact with person A at a time $\Delta t$ ago.

We don't know whether A infected B or B infected A. We know B's other close contacts.

Each test has a financial cost $C_{Tn}$. We also attach a cost per day to isolating a person $C_I$ and a cost per day of allowing an infected person to be not isolated $C_{\bar{I}|i}$.

Given this information, what is the schedule of testing/isolation of person B that minimises the expected cost.

We first need to calculate the probability distribution over B's exposure time. We assume that there is a constant rate of environmental infection (via surfaces etc.) $\rho_e$ per day, a prior probability of infection $P(i)$ and a probability of transmission given a close contact with an infected person $P(t|i)$. So, given that person B has had close contacts with people other than A at times $t_1...t_m$ ago and a close contact with A at time $t_A$ we have
\[
P_{exp}(t) = \rho_e + \sum_{k=1}^m \delta(t-t_k)P(t|i)P(i) + \delta(t-t_A)P(t|i)P_A(i)
\]
So, the probability of correctly identifying a positive case with test $n$ at time $t$ is given by
\[
P_{nt}(+|i) = \int P_n(+|i,t-t_e)P_{exp}(t_e) dt_e
\]
